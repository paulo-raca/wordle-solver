# Wordle Solver

Everybody seems to be playing wordle (and it's translations) nowadays.

I took a chance at it, played exactly once, liked it, but decided it was a computer's job.

This is a simple Python CLI tool that implements the game. Guessing and verification can be done either by the computer or by the user.

When guessing automatically, it will often (but not always) solve puzles in 4 moves.
